                                 ~Smart Color Extraction from Images~
                                 
   Color prediction using the K-Means clustering algorithm is a technique used to identify the dominant colors in an image.
It is commonly used in computer vision, image compression, and color-based categorization tasks.

Key Concepts:
K-Means Clustering: An unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions data into K distinct clusters based on similarity.

Color as Data: Each pixel's color is represented as a point in 3D space (RGB values).

Objective: Find the K most dominant colors in the image.
